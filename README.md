# Raycasting Engine
This project is a simple raycasting engine implemented in C, using OpenGL with the GLUT library. The raycasting engine simulates a 2D environment with a player perspective, casting rays to detect walls and render a basic 3D-like view.

## Features
Basic player movement and direction control.
Raycasting to detect walls and render the environment.
Simple map representation.
Rendering using OpenGL.

## Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you will need:

A C compiler (e.g., GCC).

OpenGL library.

GLUT library.

# Installation

## Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/gabrielhsdev/raycasting_C.git
cd raycasting_C
```

## Install OpenGL and GLUT:
On Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu):

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev
```

## Download and install GLUT for Windows.
Ensure that the GLUT and OpenGL libraries are properly linked in your development environment.

## Controls:
Use the arrow keys to move the player around the map.
